Studio Studio enables organisations to share & process sensitive data. It adds a simple UX interface atop state-of-the-art confidential computing security mechanisms. Studio facilitates confidential data collaboration with external partners, logs all ongoing activities. It provides detailed reports for a verifiable and trustworthy collaboration. Tower Tower manages the execution environment. It creates all the required infrastructure resources and a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE, see Confidential Computing ). Tower can orchestrate TEEs on the resources of a Cloud Service Provider of your choice, or On-Prem (see Infrastructure ). It reliably destroys all the resources once the execution is completed or compromised. Each confidential environment is single-use and immutable once created. Inspector Inspector verifies & certifies the execution environment. It validates that the hardware setup has Confidential Computing capability enabled and collects information on the hardware, firmware, and software level to attest its trustworthiness. It monitors the infrastructure and guarantees that untrustworthy environments are destroyed if they fail to meet execution policies.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#architecture","text":"Confidential Cloud is designed in 3 main microservices : Studio , Tower and Inspector .","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#studio","text":"Studio enables organisations to share & process sensitive data.

Common risks include the risk of the Cloud Service Provider being obligated to provide access to third country Government Agencies such as law enforcement or intelligence agencies. Well known examples impacting European-based companies using e.g. MS Azure, AWS, GCP and others, are the United States Federal Law named CLOUD Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act - FISA Section 702 .

Tower and Inspector are responsible for various aspects of the Life-Cycle Management (LCM) of infrastructure resources. Confidential Cloud builds atop Confidential Computing to offer state-of-the-art encryption mechanisms. Today, hardware and firmware support for Confidential Computing is only available in several modern lines of hardware platforms offered by a limited range of forward-looking Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Supported Hardware Currently, Confidential Computing is only available on a limited set of microprocessor product lines available in the market. Enterprise vendors offer several Confidential Computing implementations, with varying capabilities and performance limitations, and security trade-offs ( Read more ). Confidential Cloud currently supports the following hardware: AMD SEV-SNP Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) - Secure Nested Paging (SNP): https://www.amd.com/en/processors/amd-secure-encrypted-virtualization Upcoming - Intel\u00ae Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX) - pending hardware availability https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html - ARM\u00ae Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) - pending hardware availability and firmware support https://www.arm.com/architecture/security-features/arm-confidential-compute-architecture Decomissioned - Intel\u00ae Software Guard Extension (SGX) https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) Currently and as a default, Confidential Cloud provisions execution environments on the following CSPs: MS Azure Europe (\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea Stockholm) : default OVH (Bare-metal) Europe (\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea Frankfurt) : default OpenStack-based Europe (\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea Stockholm) : default Europe (\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 Italy) AWS Europe (\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea Stockholm) : default Partnership Programme Are you a CSP and interested to support Confidential Cloud?
