Confidential Cloud helps address legal risks for the customer entityâ€™s information asset: **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**.

Common risks include the risk of the Cloud Service Provider being obligated to provide access to third country government agencies such as law enforcement or intelligence agencies. Some well known examples are the United States Federal law named [CLOUD Act](https://www.alstonprivacy.com/cloud-act-impact-cross-border-access-contents-communications/) and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act - [FISA Section 702](https://www.dni.gov/files/icotr/Section702-Basics-Infographic.pdf).

Data and algorithms processed in Confidential Cloud **cannot be technically accessed** by anyone else than their owners.

CanaryBit is incorporated in Sweden and operates under European regulations.
