Confidential Cloud helps address legal risks for the customer entityâ€™s information asset: **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**.

Common risks include the risk of the Cloud Service Provider being obliged to provide access to third country Government Agencies such as law enforcement or intelligence agencies.
Well known examples impacting European-based companies using e.g. MS Azure, AWS, GCP and others, are the United States Federal Law named [CLOUD Act](https://www.alstonprivacy.com/cloud-act-impact-cross-border-access-contents-communications/) and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act - [FISA Section 702](https://www.dni.gov/files/icotr/Section702-Basics-Infographic.pdf).
