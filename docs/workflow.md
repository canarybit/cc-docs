# Workflow

To use Confidential Cloud Studio, you must upload a signed X.509 certificate (see [Generate a X.509 Certificate](x509_cert.md)). You must do this as a prerequisite to initiating confidential collaboration and invoking 3rd-party assets (data or algorithm).

Confidential Cloud **robust encryption mechanisms** ensure that:

1. the collaboration is fully encrypted end-to-end, including during data processing;
2. the digital asset (data or algorithm) is **never stored elsewhere than its original location**;
3. the confidential execution environment is validated and certified with a verifiable attestation report.;

The entire workflow is **logged** for auditing purposes. This enables organisations to keep **full-control** and trace back all activities involving their digital assets.

Transparent security mechanisms help organisations **build trust** between the
confidential collaboration partners, the execution environment, and CanaryBit's supporting [services](architecture.md).

Confidential Cloud enables you to collaborate using your digital assets, while ensuring that they are protected using **state of the art** encryption, authentication and authorisation mechanisms.
