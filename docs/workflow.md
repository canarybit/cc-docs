# Workflow

Confidential Cloud allows different organisations to share and process sensitive data.

Its **robust encryption mechanisms** ensure that:

1. the communication is fully secured
2. data never leaves its current location
3. the processing environments are validated and certified (see [Inspector](architecture.md)).

All organisations are required to upload a signed certificate (see [Generate a X.509 Certificate](x509_cert.md)) before initiating any collaboration and perform any execution on a 3rd-party asset (data or algorithm).

Also, the entire **workflow is logged** for auditing reasons. This way, organisations will always be able to govern and trace back all activities involving their shared data or algorithms.

The transparent security mechanisms help organisations **build trust** on their partners, the processing environment, and the supporting services, giving organisations **full-control** over their assets. Confidential Cloud simply makes sure data and algorithms are shared and processed with the most advanced encryption mechanisms.
