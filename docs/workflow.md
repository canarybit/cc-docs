# Workflow

All organisations are required to upload a signed certificate (see [Generate a X.509 Certificate](x509_cert.md)) before initiating any collaboration and perform any execution on a 3rd-party asset (data or algorithm).

Confidential Cloud **robust encryption mechanisms** ensure that:

1. the communication is fully ecncrypted
2. the stored digital asset (data or algorithm) never leaves its current location
3. the execution environment is validated and certified

Also, the entire workflow is **logged** for auditing purposes. Organisations will then be able to keep **full-control** and trace back all activities involving the shared data or algorithms.

Finally, the transparent security mechanisms help organisations **build trust** on their partners, the execution environment, and CanaryBit's supporting [services](architecture.md).

Confidential Cloud simply makes sure your digital assets are shared and processed with the **most advanced** encryption mechanisms.
