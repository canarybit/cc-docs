# Infrastructure

Confidential Cloud is a **cloud-agnostic** platform. [Tower](architecture.md#tower) and [Inspector](architecture.md#inspector) are responsibile for the full Life-Cycle Management (LCM) of the required infrastructure resources.

Confidential Cloud builds on top of Confidential Computing to offer the most advanced encryption mechanisms. Today, this capability is only available in a small set of physical servers provided buy a limited list of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

## Hardware Servers

Currently, Confidential Computing capability is only available on few a microprocessors available in the market.
Also, different vendors have different implementation, with different capabilities and performance limitations ([Read more](https://www.canarybit.eu/comparing-confidential-computing-platforms/)).

Confidential Cloud currently supports the following hardware:

### AMD SEV-SNP

- Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) - Secure Nested Paging (SNP): [https://www.amd.com/en/processors/amd-secure-encrypted-virtualization](https://www.amd.com/en/processors/amd-secure-encrypted-virtualization)
