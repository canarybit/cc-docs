# Infrastructure

Confidential Cloud is **cloud-agnostic**. [Tower](architecture.md#tower) and [Inspector](architecture.md#inspector) are responsible for various aspects of the Life-Cycle Management (LCM) of infrastructure resources.

Confidential Cloud builds atop Confidential Computing to offer state-of-the-art encryption mechanisms.
Today, hardware and firmware support for Confidential Computing is widely available in modern lines of hardware platforms offered by forward-looking Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

## Supported Hardware

Support for Confidential Computing widely available on microprocessor product lines available on the market.
Enterprise vendors offer several Confidential Computing implementations, with varying capabilities and performance limitations, and security trade-offs ([Read more](https://www.canarybit.eu/comparing-confidential-computing-platforms/)).

Confidential Cloud currently supports the following hardware:

### AMD SEV-SNP

- Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) - Secure Nested Paging (SNP): [https://www.amd.com/en/processors/amd-secure-encrypted-virtualization](https://www.amd.com/en/processors/amd-secure-encrypted-virtualization)
