# Infrastructure

Confidential Cloud is **cloud-agnostic**. [Tower](architecture.md#tower) and [Inspector](architecture.md#inspector) are responsible for various aspects of the Life-Cycle Management (LCM) of infrastructure resources.

Confidential Cloud builds atop Confidential Computing to offer state-of-the-art encryption mechanisms. Today, hardware and firmware support for Confidential Computing is only available in several modern lines of hardware platforms offered by a limited number of forward-looking Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

## Supported Hardware

Currently, Confidential Computing is only available on a limited set of microprocessor product lines available in the market.
Enterprise vendors offer several Confidential Computing implementations, with varying capabilities and performance limitations, and security trade-offs ([Read more](https://www.canarybit.eu/comparing-confidential-computing-platforms/)).

Confidential Cloud currently supports the following hardware:

### AMD SEV-SNP

- Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) - Secure Nested Paging (SNP): [https://www.amd.com/en/processors/amd-secure-encrypted-virtualization](https://www.amd.com/en/processors/amd-secure-encrypted-virtualization)

## On-Prem / Air-gapped

Confidential Cloud can be configured to deploy resouces On-Prem. This allows to support use cases that require operations in a closely controlled domain - or even as an **air-gapped** setup.
